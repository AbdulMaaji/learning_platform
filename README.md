🧠 DevLab API — Pure Python Learning Platform

Welcome to DevLab, a minimal backend built entirely with pure Python — no frameworks — to help students learn coding fundamentals and API design from scratch.

🚀 Features

✅ Built with only Python’s standard library (http.server)

✅ Simple JSON-based “database” (data/lessons.json)

✅ REST-like GET routes

/ → Welcome message

/lessons → Returns all lessons

🧱 Clean structure that can evolve into a full learning platform
